# Generator Integration Verification

This document outlines the steps to verify that the generators are properly integrated with the new domain model.

## Integration Status

1. **Article Generator**:

   - Properly integrated with the article service
   - Called via `generate` function from `@/features/generators/lesson`
   - Used in `generateArticleContent` method of the article service

2. **Tooltip Generator**:

   - Properly integrated with the contextual tooltip service
   - Called via `generateTooltips` function from `@/features/generators/tooltips`
   - Used in `processArticleContent` method of the contextual tooltip service

3. **Question Generator**:
   - Properly integrated with the user question service
   - Called via `generateSuggestedQuestionsApi` function from `@/features/generators/suggested-questions`
   - Used in `generateSuggestedQuestions` method of the user question service

## Manual Testing Steps

To verify that the generators are working correctly with the new domain model, follow these steps:

### 1. Article Generator Verification

1. Navigate to a subject in the application
2. Select a module to learn about
3. Verify that an article is generated and displayed
4. Check the browser console for any errors related to article generation

Expected outcome:

- The article should be generated and displayed without errors
- The content should be properly formatted with bolded terms

### 2. Tooltip Generator Verification

1. After an article is generated, hover over bolded terms
2. Verify that tooltips appear with explanations
3. Check the browser console for any errors related to tooltip generation

Expected outcome:

- Tooltips should appear when hovering over bolded terms
- The tooltips should contain relevant explanations
- No errors should be logged in the console

### 3. Question Generator Verification

1. After an article is generated, check for suggested questions
2. Verify that a list of questions is displayed
3. Click on a question to generate a new article
4. Check the browser console for any errors related to question generation

Expected outcome:

- A list of suggested questions should be displayed
- Clicking on a question should generate a new article
- The personal learning map visualization should update to show the new article and the question connection
- No errors should be logged in the console

## Troubleshooting

If any of the generators are not working correctly, check the following:

1. **API Errors**:

   - Check the browser console for API errors
   - Verify that the API endpoints are properly configured

2. **Integration Issues**:

   - Verify that the service is calling the generator with the correct parameters
   - Check that the generator response is properly handled by the service

3. **Orchestration Issues**:
   - Verify that the learning orchestrator is properly coordinating the services
   - Check that the orchestrator is handling errors correctly

## Next Steps

After verifying that the generators are properly integrated, proceed to the next steps in the implementation plan:

1. UI Refinements
2. Performance Optimization
3. Error Handling and Recovery
4. Testing and Validation
5. Cleanup and Documentation
